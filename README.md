# openDream

I've been seeing a whole lot of pastebin on reddit lately and it's getting ridiculous. It's getting about time we get more organized. So, I've taken the liberty of making a centralized github page for individuals playing around and/or experimenting to put their code. Message SlimeQ (or another owner) here or on reddit if you want to be added to the deepdream-community organization and/or contribute. I have basically no idea how organizations work on here, so feel free to make suggestions or help out in any way. 

For starters, I'm adding a modularized version of the original Python code from Google and an opticalflow flow script that I found randomly on reddit yesterday that is *very* cool.

More to come, hopefully. Hop on board!
